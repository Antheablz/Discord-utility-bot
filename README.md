## Discord Bot Functionalities 

This is a basic utility and game Discord Bot used on my personal server. 


* "$commandList"
    - Bot will send a list of commands into the discord server.

* "$hello"
    - Bot will send "Hello!!" into the chat.

* "$coinFlip"
    - User can play a heads and tails game against Bot.
    - Bot randomly chooses between "heads" and "tails"
    - User will win if their selection matches the Bot's, otherwise the Bot wins!

* "reactionRoles"
    - Allows a user to receive a random colour role after clicking the emoji sent by the bot into the chat. 
    - User's role will be removed if emoji is de-selected.
    - A new random colour is given each time user re-clicks the emoji.
